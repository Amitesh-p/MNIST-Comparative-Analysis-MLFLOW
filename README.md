"# MNIST-Comparative-Analysis-MLFLOW" 

This repository consist of all the important concepts of Perceptron , Artificial Neural Network , Activation function , Optimization process, Batch Normalization , Transfer function . Further a comparative analysis on the implementation of MNIST Fashion dataset using ANN is done using multiple acitvation function with MLFLOW . Tabular representation of the results obtained from MLFLOW are shown below .
